# 🧠 Deep Autonomous AI Research Agent

A production-style **Autonomous Research Agent** capable of independently planning, searching, analyzing, and generating structured research reports — fully powered by **local large language models** with zero API dependency.

Designed with modern **agentic architecture**, this system simulates real-world AI workflows used in advanced research environments.

## ⭐ Overview

This project implements a multi-step autonomous AI agent that can:

✅ Plan complex research tasks  
✅ Search the web for relevant sources  
✅ Analyze retrieved information  
✅ Generate structured research reports  
✅ Operate entirely on local LLMs (no API costs)  

The architecture mirrors production-grade agent systems.
